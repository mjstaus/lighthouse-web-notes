## Intro to Event-Driven Architecture

---
EDA = when X happens, then do Y

Where:
- X is the event
- Y is the event-handler

Client-Side Events:
- From the DOM
- egs. onClick, onHover, onFocus, etc

Server-Side Events:
- Eg. on a server running node, we have an incoming request (then handle with a response)
