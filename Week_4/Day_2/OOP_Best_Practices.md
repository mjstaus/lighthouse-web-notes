## OOP Best Practices
---
### Abstraction
---

"Abstraction is a technique for arranging complexity of computer systems. It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level."

---
### Private VS Public
---
In some languages we can make properties `private1`, but not in JavaScript :(

In JS, we add an `_` to the start of the property name to signal to other developers not to access this property directly

---
### Single Responsibility Principle
---

A class should be responsible for a **single part** of the app's functionality (should only have ONE JOB)

---
### Inheritance
---

Used to reduce duplicate code and make the code more reusable
