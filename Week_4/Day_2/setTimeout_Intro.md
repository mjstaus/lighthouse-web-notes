## Intro to `setTimeout`
---

`setTimeout` is used to delay execution of code (specified as a callback) until a later time (specified in ms)

```javascript
setTimeout(callback, delay)
```
> This is overly simplified for now, setTimeout actually can take a more params

### What's it Used For?

Examples:
1. Show a notice to a user and then automatically close it
2. Try reconnecting after a certain amount of time passes when "disconnected" (like on compass!)
3. Open up a pop-up window or in-window chat button a few seconds after landing on a site
4. That adblocker popup prompt from websites that shows up after a couple seconds

>For now, we're going to use setTimeout as a learning tool for understanding/practicing async functions!
