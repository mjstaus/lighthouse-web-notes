## Intro to Networking
---
Computer Network = 2 or more computers that are connected and can talk to one another!

The internet is a network (the largest network!), and so is my laptop+phone when they're connected by USB

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
---

TCP allows 2 machines to establish open channel for two-way communication (like a phone call)

One party dials a specific number (**IP address**) to contact the other party

A computer can have many connections open at the same time, like how a company can have many different phone lines open (using extension) -> in computers these are called **ports**

TCP is a specific type of protocol used to structure and workflow data over the network
