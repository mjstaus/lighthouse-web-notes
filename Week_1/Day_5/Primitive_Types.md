## Primitive Types 

### Six Primitive Types
1. Undefined
2. Null
3. Boolean
4. String
5. Number
6. Symbol

### Objects are NOT Primitives
Anything that's not a primitive type is an OBJECT

Arrays and functions are sub-categories of Objects.

Objects have PROPERTIES!

The six primitive types + Objects = 7 fundamental types in JS.
