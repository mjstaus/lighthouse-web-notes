## Getting Comfortable with Error Messages

### Common Errror Messages:
1. Syntax Errors
  * Tell us WHERE the error occurred (js: line) - doesn't always work, but good place to start looking
  * Include a STACK TRACE - shows the state of the program when the error occurred (more on this later!)
  * Unexpected Token = usually a missing bracket, parentheses, or curly brace
2. Reference Errors
  * When you try to use the value of an undefined variable
3. Type Errors

Takeaway message: Read the error message closely, then inspect the problematic line of code for typos, syntax errors, or other mistakes.
