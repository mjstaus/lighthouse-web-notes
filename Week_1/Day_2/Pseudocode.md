## Using Pseudocode to Solve Problems
___
Before starting writing code, you need to describe in WORDS what you want to accomplish. Once you've figured out what you WANT to do, then it's just down to figuring out the syntax needed to get it done. 

### Example (from Loopy Lighthouse exercise): 
```javascript Loop from 100 to 200:
  Let num = the current step in the loop
  If num % 3 is equal to 0 and num % 4 is equal to 0:
    Print "LoopyLighthouse"
  Else if num % 3 is equal to 0:
    Print "Loopy"
  Else if num % 4 is equal to 0:
    Print "Lighthouse"
  Otherwise
    Print num
  End if
End loop 
```
