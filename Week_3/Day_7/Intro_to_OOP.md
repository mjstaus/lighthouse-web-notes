## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

- Way of writing code that encourages *modularity* and *reduces duplication* through use of *objects*
- It is a **software development paradigm**
- Popular way to solve code oragnization, re-use, modularity

(Predominantly)OOP Languages:
- PHP
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- Ruby
- Swift
- Objective-C 

Functional Programming Languages (different paradigm):
- Erlang
- Common Lisp
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Clojure

### What about Javascript?
It has multiple paradigms! Both functional and OOP! This makes it flexible, but maybe confusing too
